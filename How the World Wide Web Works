How the World Wide Web works. 

When you visit a web page, you activate a conversation in the internet through one of its many applications, the web. 
The web is composed of texts, images, videos which are held in its pages or computers. When many pages belong to a same site
or computer, it becomes a website. A web page can lead to another page on the same site, or to a completely different website.
To enter a webpage, you enter its URL into the web. The web uses the internet for its web of computers and pages to connect 
and converse. The conversation happens between the web browser, and the web server, and is known as HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer 
Protocol), in which the web browser asks the web server through a simple language, HTML language, a series of commands 
the web browser’s host computer, the client, sent out. To clarify,HTTP is a way of conversation in the internet that serves 
this specific purpose, and is done through the HTML language mentioned before. The web browser and web server chat away the 
command requester in the client computer, the browser looks for it, and sends the information or webpage, back to the browser 
and it pops up on your screen. The web page reached will be composed not only of images, texts and more, but of links and
hyperlinks that take you to other pages. If you click one of them, the browser again sends a message to the server, which 
looks for and sends back what the client is looking for, and it pops up on their screen. All of this happened because of the 
internet’s ability to connect computers, and the web across the whole wide world, through telephone lines that send simple
messages back and forth.
